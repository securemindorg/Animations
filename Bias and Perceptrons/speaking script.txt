**I. Introduction (30 seconds)**
Have you ever wonder why AI seems to make biased decisions? In today's world of artificial intelligence, we often hear about AI systems showing unexpected biases - from unfair hiring practices to discriminatory loan approvals. The answer to why this happens lies in AI's simplest building block: the perceptron. Today, we'll explore how these fundamental units work, how bias creeps in, and most importantly, what we can do about it. Understanding this is crucial for building the fair and ethical AI systems our future demands."

**II. What is a Perceptron? (1 minute)**
"Think of a perceptron as AI's decision-making muscle. Just like our brain's neurons, it takes in multiple inputs, weighs their importance, and makes a decision. Here's how it works: These input nodes receive different pieces of information. Each connection has a weight - think of it as how important that input is to the final decision. There's also a bias node, which acts like a threshold for making decisions. Finally, the activation function determines the final yes-or-no output. When combined, these elements form the basic decision-making unit that powers modern AI systems."

**III. How Perceptrons Learn (2 minutes)**
"Let's see how perceptrons learn using a real-world example: imagine training an AI to sort job applications. The perceptron receives various inputs like years of experience, education level, and skills. During training, it adjusts its weights based on whether its decisions were correct or not. If it makes a mistake, it tweaks these weights to do better next time. The bias term helps fine-tune where the decision boundary should be - like setting a minimum threshold for qualification. Watch how the decision boundary shifts as the perceptron learns from more examples. This process seems straightforward, but it's where things can start to go wrong."

**IV. Where Bias Enters (2 minutes)**
"Bias can enter the system in three major ways. First, through training data bias. If our historical hiring data mostly shows successful male candidates, the perceptron will learn to favor male applicants - it's the classic 'garbage in, garbage out' principle. Watch how this skews the decision boundary.

Second, we have feature selection bias. If we only look at certain characteristics while ignoring others, we're building blind spots into our system. For example, focusing solely on university rankings might disadvantage qualified candidates from less prestigious schools.

Third, historical data reflection. Past discriminatory practices become encoded in the weights themselves. Look at how these historical patterns create a feedback loop that perpetuates existing biases."

**V. Bias Amplification (2 minutes)**
"What starts as a small bias doesn't stay small. Through feedback loops and reinforcement, these biases get amplified over time. Watch this visualization of the 'snowball effect.' Each decision influences future training data, which leads to stronger biases, which affect more decisions - creating a cascading effect. A slight initial preference can quickly become a strong systematic bias. This is particularly dangerous because it can make the bias appear to be validated by data, when in reality, it's just amplifying existing prejudices."

**VI. Real-World Implications (1.5 minutes)**
"These biases have serious real-world consequences. In hiring algorithms, qualified candidates get filtered out based on historical patterns. Loan approval systems may discriminate against certain neighborhoods or communities. Facial recognition systems show lower accuracy for minorities and women. Even in healthcare, AI systems can show reduced accuracy in diagnosing conditions for certain demographic groups. These aren't just technical issues - they're affecting real people's lives every day."

**VII. Solutions and Mitigation (1 minute)**
"But there's hope. We can address these issues through several key strategies: First, ensuring our training data is balanced and representative. Second, carefully selecting and validating input features. Third, implementing regular bias audits to catch problems early. Fourth, maintaining meaningful human oversight of AI decisions. And finally, building diverse development teams who can spot potential biases before they become problems. Each of these solutions plays a crucial role in creating fairer AI systems."

**VIII. Conclusion (30 seconds)**
"Understanding how perceptrons can amplify bias is the first step toward building better AI systems. As we've seen, small biases can quickly become significant problems, but with proper awareness and the right mitigation strategies, we can create AI systems that are both powerful and fair. The future of AI depends on our ability to understand and address these fundamental issues. Let's commit to building AI systems that work fairly for everyone."
