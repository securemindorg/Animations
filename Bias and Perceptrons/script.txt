I. Introduction (30 seconds)
- Hook: "Ever wonder why AI seems to make biased decisions? The answer lies in its simplest building block - the perceptron."
- Brief overview of what will be covered
- Why this matters for modern AI systems

II. What is a Perceptron? (1 minute)
- Visual demonstration of a perceptron
  • Input nodes
  • Weights
  • Bias node
  • Activation function
- Simple analogy: "Think of it as an AI's decision-making muscle"

III. How Perceptrons Learn (2 minutes)
- Visual demonstration of:
  • Training data input
  • Weight adjustments
  • Role of bias term
  • Decision boundary formation
- Real-world example: "Imagine training a perceptron to sort job applications"

IV. Where Bias Enters (2 minutes)
1. Training Data Bias
   • Show how biased input data affects weight distribution
   • Visual example of skewed decision boundaries
   • "Garbage in, garbage out" principle

2. Feature Selection Bias
   • Demonstrate how choosing certain inputs over others affects decisions
   • Example: "If we only look at certain characteristics..."

3. Historical Data Reflection
   • Show how past biases get encoded into weights
   • Example using employment data patterns

V. Bias Amplification (2 minutes)
- Demonstrate how small initial biases get amplified through:
  • Feedback loops
  • Reinforcement
  • Cascade effects
- Visual representation of bias snowball effect

VI. Real-World Implications (1.5 minutes)
- Examples of bias manifestation in:
  • Hiring algorithms
  • Loan approval systems
  • Facial recognition
  • Healthcare decisions

VII. Solutions and Mitigation (1 minute)
- Balanced training data
- Careful feature selection
- Regular bias audits
- Human oversight
- Diverse development teams

VIII. Conclusion (30 seconds)
- Recap of how perceptrons can amplify bias
- Call to action for responsible AI development
- "Understanding the root cause helps us build better, fairer AI"
